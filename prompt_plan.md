Chunk 9.3: Network & Subscription Error Handling
Step 9.3.1: Refine error messages for no internet (login, update check) and expired subscription (login, session start).
Phase 10: Packaging (Conceptual - LLM won't do this, but good to note)

Step 10.1: Use PyInstaller, Briefcase, or similar to package for Windows, macOS, Linux.
Step 10.2: Create installers (.exe, .dmg).
LLM Prompts for Code Generation
We will use PyQt6. Each prompt assumes the LLM has the context of the previously generated code.

Important Note for the LLM:

Manage imports as needed (e.g., from PyQt6.QtWidgets import ..., import mediapipe as mp, import cv2, import supabase, etc.).
Structure the code into appropriate classes and methods.
Use clear variable and function names.
Add comments for complex logic.
For now, Supabase URL and Anon Key can be placeholders.
Prompt 1: Basic Application Structure with PyQt6

Plaintext

Initialize a new Python project for "PostureApp".
Create a main application using PyQt6.
The main window (`QMainWindow`) should be titled "[PostureApp]".
Implement a `QStackedWidget` within the main window to manage different views.
Define two placeholder QWidget classes: `LoginView` and `DashboardView`. Add instances of these to the QStackedWidget.
On application start, show the `LoginView`.
The main window should have a fixed initial size, e.g., 800x600.
Ensure the application runs and displays an empty window (which is actually the `LoginView` placeholder).
Prompt 2: Login View UI Implementation

Plaintext

Based on the previous PyQt6 application structure:
Flesh out the `LoginView` QWidget. It should contain:
1.  A QLabel for the application name "[PostureApp]" (large font).
2.  A QLabel for an application logo (use a placeholder QPixmap for now, e.g., a 100x100 gray square).
3.  A QLabel with the text: "Improve your posture with real-time feedback."
4.  A QLineEdit for "Email".
5.  A QLineEdit for "Password" (set echo mode to Password).
6.  A QPushButton "Login".
7.  A QLabel that can act as a clickable link: "Sign-up / Forgot Password" (for now, it doesn't need to do anything when clicked).
Arrange these elements in a clear, centered vertical layout. Add some basic spacing.
The main window should now display this login form.
Prompt 3: Dashboard View UI Skeleton

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
Flesh out the `DashboardView` QWidget. It should contain the following placeholder elements, arranged reasonably (e.g., using VBox and HBox layouts):
1.  A QPushButton "Start Session".
2.  A QPushButton "Settings".
3.  A section for "User Account Information":
    * A QLabel "Subscription Status: -" (placeholder text).
    * A QPushButton "Manage Subscription".
4.  A section for "Reminders Graph":
    * A QLabel "Posture Reminders Over Time".
    * A placeholder QWidget or QLabel where a graph will eventually go (e.g., a gray box with text "Graph Area").
This view is not yet visible. We will switch to it after login in a later step.
Prompt 4: Basic Navigation and Supabase Client Setup

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Install the `supabase-py` library.
2.  In your main application class or a new `auth_service.py` module, initialize the Supabase client. Use placeholder strings for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
3.  Modify the "Login" button's click handler in `LoginView`. For now, on click, print the email and password to the console.
4.  Implement a method in your main window class `show_dashboard_view()` that switches the `QStackedWidget` to display the `DashboardView`.
5.  Implement a method `show_login_view()` to switch back to `LoginView`.
6.  Temporarily, make the "Login" button in `LoginView`, after printing credentials, call `show_dashboard_view()`.
7.  Add a QLabel to the `LoginView` for displaying error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials"). Initially, it should be hidden or empty.
Prompt 5: Supabase Authentication and Subscription Info

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Modify the "Login" button's click handler in `LoginView`:
    * Retrieve email and password from the QLineEdits.
    * Call Supabase to sign in the user (`supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password()`).
    * If login is successful:
        * (Placeholder) Assume a successful login implies an active subscription for now. We'll refine this.
        * Call `show_dashboard_view()`.
        * Clear any previous error messages on the LoginView.
    * If login fails (invalid credentials, network error):
        * Display an appropriate error message in the error QLabel on `LoginView` (e.g., "Invalid email or password." or "Network error. Please check your connection.").
2.  In the `DashboardView`, when it becomes visible (e.g., in its `showEvent` or when `show_dashboard_view` is called):
    * (Placeholder) Fetch user's email (e.g., from the Supabase session object if available, or just use the one entered at login for now).
    * Update the "Subscription Status" QLabel to something like "Subscription: Active for user@example.com". We will fetch real subscription data later.
3.  Implement the "Manage Subscription" button in `DashboardView` to open a hardcoded URL (e.g., "https://app.supabase.com") in the default web browser using `QDesktopServices.openUrl()`.
4.  Add a "Logout" button to the `DashboardView`. When clicked, it should call `supabase.auth.sign_out()`, then switch back to the `LoginView`.
Self-correction: The spec mentions checking for an active subscription from Supabase. This might involve a separate table lookup after login. Let's defer the detailed subscription check for a moment and assume login success implies an active subscription to keep this step focused on auth.

Prompt 6: Refining Subscription Status and Handling Inactive Subscriptions

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Assume after a successful Supabase login, you have a user object. This user object has an ID.
2.  Simulate a Supabase table named `user_subscriptions` with columns `user_id` (matches auth user ID), `status` (text, e.g., 'active', 'expired'), and `expires_at` (date/timestamp).
3.  After successful login in the "Login" button's handler:
    * Perform a query to the (simulated) `user_subscriptions` table to fetch the subscription record for the logged-in user's ID.
    * If no record is found, or if the `status` is not 'active', or if `expires_at` is in the past:
        * Display an error message on `LoginView`: "Your subscription has expired or is inactive. Please visit [WebAppURL/SubscriptionPage] to renew." (Use a placeholder URL).
        * Do NOT proceed to the dashboard. Sign the user out (`supabase.auth.sign_out()`).
    * If the subscription is active:
        * Store the `status` and `expires_at` (or a formatted string like "Active until YYYY-MM-DD") to be displayed on the dashboard.
        * Proceed to `show_dashboard_view()`.
4.  When `DashboardView` is shown, update the "Subscription Status" QLabel with the fetched and stored subscription information (e.g., "Subscription: Active until 2025-12-31").
5.  If checking subscription requires an internet connection and it fails, the login error handler should also cover this: "Could not verify subscription. Please check your internet connection."
Prompt 7: Webcam Integration with QThread

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Install `opencv-python` if not already (for webcam access).
2.  Create a new QWidget or a dedicated area within the `DashboardView` (e.g., a QLabel named `webcam_feed_label`) to display the webcam feed. It should be a noticeable size, e.g., 640x480.
3.  Create a new QThread subclass (e.g., `WebcamThread`).
    * This thread will be responsible for capturing frames from the webcam.
    * It should have a `run()` method that continuously captures frames.
    * It should emit a signal (e.g., `new_frame_ready(QImage)`) with the captured frame converted to a QImage.
    * Add methods to `start_capture(camera_index)` and `stop_capture()`.
4.  In your main application or `DashboardView`:
    * Instantiate `WebcamThread`.
    * Connect the `new_frame_ready` signal to a slot/method that updates `webcam_feed_label` with the new QImage.
5.  When the "Start Session" button on the `DashboardView` is clicked (for now, just this part):
    * (Placeholder) Disable "Start Session" button, enable a new "Stop Session" button (add this button now).
    * Start the `WebcamThread` (e.g., using camera index 0).
    * The webcam feed should appear in `webcam_feed_label`.
6.  The "Stop Session" button should:
    * Call `webcam_thread.stop_capture()`.
    * Wait for the thread to finish.
    * Clear the `webcam_feed_label`.
    * Enable "Start Session" and disable "Stop Session".
Ensure proper thread management (starting, stopping, quitting).
Prompt 8: MediaPipe Pose Integration in Webcam Thread

Plaintext

Based on the previous code with `WebcamThread`:
1.  Install `mediapipe`. Download the `pose_landmarker_lite.task` model file (or specify to use a path to it).
2.  Modify `WebcamThread`:
    * In its `__init__` or a setup method, initialize MediaPipe Pose Landmarker (`mediapipe.tasks.vision.PoseLandmarker`). Use `RUNNING_MODE.LIVE_STREAM` if suitable for continuous processing, or process frame by frame.
    * In the `run()` method, after capturing a frame (NumPy array from OpenCV):
        * Convert the frame to `mediapipe.Image`.
        * Process the image with the pose landmarker to get pose landmarks.
        * If landmarks are detected:
            * (Optional visual debug) Draw the landmarks onto the frame (NumPy array) using `mediapipe.solutions.drawing_utils`.
        * The `new_frame_ready` signal should now emit the (potentially annotated) frame as a QImage.
3.  Handle potential errors during MediaPipe initialization or processing (e.g., model file not found).
The webcam feed displayed in the UI should now show pose landmarks if a person is visible.
Key landmarks to eventually focus on are: `LEFT_SHOULDER` (11), `RIGHT_SHOULDER` (12), `NOSE` (0), `LEFT_EAR` (7), `RIGHT_EAR` (8).
Prompt 9: Posture Calibration UI and Logic

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  When the "Start Session" button is clicked, before starting the continuous `WebcamThread` as it currently does, first transition to a "Calibration Step." This could mean:
    * Showing a QDialog for calibration.
    * Or, re-purposing the webcam feed area on the Dashboard to show calibration instructions. Let's choose the latter for simplicity: overlay instructions on the webcam feed area or next to it.
2.  During this calibration step:
    * Display text instructions: "Sit upright. Shoulders relaxed and back. Head aligned over shoulders. Eyes looking straight ahead. Click 'Capture Good Posture' when ready."
    * Display an example image of good posture (use a placeholder QPixmap if no image is available).
    * Show a "Capture Good Posture" button and a "Cancel Calibration" button.
    * The webcam feed should be active and visible with MediaPipe landmarks.
3.  Implement a class attribute or instance variable in your main app or session manager to store `reference_angles = {'head_forward': None, 'shoulder_line': None}`.
4.  When "Capture Good Posture" is clicked:
    * Get the latest landmarks from MediaPipe (ensure a valid pose is detected).
    * Implement helper functions:
        * `calculate_shoulder_midpoint(left_shoulder_lm, right_shoulder_lm)`
        * `calculate_ear_midpoint(left_ear_lm, right_ear_lm)`
        * `calculate_angle_2d(p1_x, p1_y, p2_x, p2_y, p3_x, p3_y)`: Calculates angle between vector p1-p2 and p1-p3. Or a simpler horizontal angle for shoulders.
    * Calculate **Head Position Reference**:
        * This is tricky. A simple proxy: Use the X-coordinate difference between `NOSE` and `SHOULDER_MIDPOINT`. Or, the angle of a line from `SHOULDER_MIDPOINT` to `EAR_MIDPOINT` relative to vertical. For now, let's try: angle of the vector from shoulder midpoint to nose with the vertical axis (assuming the user is facing forward). Store this angle in `reference_angles['head_forward']`.
    * Calculate **Shoulder Alignment Reference**: Angle of the line connecting `LEFT_SHOULDER` and `RIGHT_SHOULDER` with respect to the horizontal axis. Store this in `reference_angles['shoulder_line']`.
    * Provide feedback: "Calibration successful! Monitoring started."
    * Then, proceed to start the continuous monitoring (the existing `WebcamThread` functionality).
    * The "Start Session" button should now be labeled "Stop Session".
5.  The "Cancel Calibration" button should stop the webcam, clear instructions, and revert the UI to before "Start Session" was clicked.
6.  If "Stop Session" is clicked, clear `reference_angles`.
Prompt 10: Real-time Posture Monitoring and Deviation Detection

Plaintext

Based on the previous code, particularly the `WebcamThread` and calibration logic:
1.  During active monitoring (after calibration is successful and `WebcamThread` is running):
    * In each frame processed by `WebcamThread` where landmarks are detected:
        * Recalculate the current head position angle and current shoulder line angle using the same methods as in calibration.
        * Calculate the absolute difference between the current head angle and `reference_angles['head_forward']`. This is `head_deviation_angle`.
        * Calculate the absolute difference between the current shoulder line angle and `reference_angles['shoulder_line']`. This is `shoulder_deviation_angle`.
    * Define a hardcoded default sensitivity threshold, e.g., `DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY_DEGREES = 20`.
    * If `head_deviation_angle > DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY_DEGREES` OR `shoulder_deviation_angle > DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY_DEGREES`:
        * A deviation is detected. For now, print "Posture deviation detected!" to the console. We will implement alerts in the next step.
        * Keep a count of these deviation events (reminders) for the current session. This count should be stored in a variable, e.g., `current_session_reminder_count`, initialized to 0 when a session starts.
2.  When the "Stop Session" button is clicked:
    * Print the `current_session_reminder_count` to the console.
    * Reset `current_session_reminder_count` to 0.
Prompt 11: Implementing Audio and Visual Alerts with Cooldown

Plaintext

Based on the previous posture deviation detection logic:
1.  Prepare a sound file named `alert.wav` (or .mp3) with a voice saying "Fix the posture." (If you cannot create/use a sound file, simulate by printing "AUDIO ALERT: Fix the posture!"). Use `PyQt6.QtMultimedia.QSoundEffect` for playing audio.
2.  Create a simple, non-modal visual alert mechanism. This could be a `QLabel` that appears as an overlay on the main window or a custom frameless `QDialog` that shows briefly. It should display the default text: "Fix your posture!"
3.  Modify the deviation detection logic:
    * When a deviation is detected (and exceeds `DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY_DEGREES`):
        * Increment `current_session_reminder_count`.
        * Trigger the audio alert.
        * Trigger the visual alert (show it for a few seconds, then hide).
4.  Implement an alert cooldown:
    * Add a variable `last_alert_time = 0`.
    * Define `ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 10` (or similar).
    * Only trigger an alert if `current_time - last_alert_time > ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`.
    * Update `last_alert_time` when an alert is triggered.
5.  Ensure alerts are triggered from the main GUI thread. If deviation is detected in `WebcamThread`, emit a signal to the main thread to show the alerts.
Prompt 12: Settings Dialog UI

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Create a new `QDialog` subclass named `SettingsDialog`.
2.  Add the following UI elements to `SettingsDialog`, arranged clearly:
    * **Sensitivity for Deviation Detection:**
        * A QLabel "Sensitivity:"
        * A QSlider (Horizontal) or QComboBox with options: "Low," "Medium," "High." (Default: Medium).
    * **Notification Mode:**
        * A QLabel "Notification Mode:"
        * QRadioButtons: "Audio Alert Only," "Visual Alert Only," "Both Audio and Visual Alerts" (Default: Both). Group them with a QButtonGroup.
    * **Custom Pop-up Message Text:**
        * A QLabel "Custom Alert Message:"
        * A QLineEdit with default text: "Fix your posture!"
    * **Webcam Selection:**
        * A QLabel "Select Webcam:"
        * A QComboBox `webcam_selector_combobox`.
    * Standard buttons: "Save" (or "OK") and "Cancel".
3.  Connect the "Settings" button on the `DashboardView` to create and show this `SettingsDialog` modally.
4.  For "Webcam Selection":
    * Implement a function (e.g., in your main app or a utility module) `get_available_cameras()` that returns a list of available camera indices and names (e.g., using OpenCV or another method).
    * Populate `webcam_selector_combobox` with these camera names when the `SettingsDialog` is initialized. Store the camera index associated with each name.
Prompt 13: Settings Logic - Persistence and Application

Plaintext

Based on the `SettingsDialog` UI:
1.  Use `PyQt6.QtCore.QSettings` to persist application settings. Define an organization name and application name for `QSettings`.
2.  **Loading Settings:**
    * When `SettingsDialog` is initialized, load saved values for sensitivity, notification mode, custom message, and selected webcam index.
    * Set the UI elements in `SettingsDialog` to reflect these loaded values. If no saved values, use defaults (Medium sensitivity, Both alerts, "Fix your posture!", default webcam index 0).
3.  **Saving Settings:**
    * When the "Save" (or "OK") button in `SettingsDialog` is clicked:
        * Retrieve the current values from all UI elements (sensitivity, notification mode, custom message, selected webcam index from `webcam_selector_combobox`).
        * Save these values using `QSettings`.
        * Close the dialog.
    * When "Cancel" is clicked, simply close the dialog without saving.
4.  **Applying Settings:**
    * Store the loaded/saved settings in main application variables (e.g., `self.app_settings`).
    * **Sensitivity:** The "Low," "Medium," "High" options should map to specific angular degree thresholds (e.g., Low=30, Medium=20, High=10). The posture deviation logic should use the currently set sensitivity threshold from `self.app_settings`.
    * **Notification Mode:** The alert triggering logic should check `self.app_settings['notification_mode']` and only trigger audio, visual, or both as selected.
    * **Custom Message:** The visual alert should display the text from `self.app_settings['custom_alert_message']`.
    * **Webcam Selection:** If the selected webcam in settings changes, the application should re-initialize `WebcamThread` with the new camera index the next time a session is started (or immediately if a session is active and this is desired, though that's more complex). For now, apply on next session start.
5.  Ensure settings are loaded when the application starts, so they are available before the settings dialog is first opened.
Prompt 14: Local Data Storage for Reminder Graph (SQLite)

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Install `sqlite3` (usually bundled with Python).
2.  Create a new module (e.g., `data_manager.py`).
3.  In `data_manager.py`, implement functions:
    * `init_db()`: Creates an SQLite database file (e.g., `posture_stats.db`) if it doesn't exist. This DB should have a table `sessions` with columns: `session_date` (TEXT, format YYYY-MM-DD), `reminder_count` (INTEGER).
    * `add_session_data(date_str, count)`: Inserts a new row into the `sessions` table.
    * `get_session_data()`: Retrieves all rows from the `sessions` table, ordered by date.
4.  Call `init_db()` once when the application starts.
5.  Modify the "Stop Session" logic:
    * When a session is stopped, get the current date (YYYY-MM-DD) and the `current_session_reminder_count`.
    * Call `add_session_data()` with this date and count.
Prompt 15: Displaying Reminder Graph on Dashboard

Plaintext

Based on the previous code and `data_manager.py`:
1.  Install `matplotlib` and ensure it's compatible with PyQt6 embedding (often involves `FigureCanvasQTAgg`).
2.  In `DashboardView`, replace the placeholder "Graph Area" QWidget with a `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAgg` widget.
3.  When `DashboardView` becomes visible (or is updated):
    * Call `data_manager.get_session_data()` to fetch all session records.
    * If data exists:
        * Clear any previous graph on the canvas.
        * Create a bar chart using Matplotlib:
            * X-axis: Dates of sessions.
            * Y-axis: Total count of reminders for that session.
        * Format the X-axis labels to be readable (e.g., rotate if many dates).
        * Set a title for the graph, e.g., "Posture Reminders Per Session."
        * Draw the graph on the canvas.
    * If no data exists, display a message like "No session data yet." on the graph canvas.
4.  The graph should update whenever the `DashboardView` is shown, reflecting any newly added session data.
Prompt 16: System Tray Icon and Basic Menu

Plaintext

Based on the previous PyQt6 application:
1.  Create a `QSystemTrayIcon`.
    * Use a placeholder icon (e.g., load a simple .png or use a standard Qt icon if available).
    * Set a tooltip for the tray icon, e.g., "[PostureApp]".
2.  Create a `QMenu` for the tray icon. Add the following actions:
    * "Open [PostureApp] Window"
    * "Start Session" (this label will be dynamic later)
    * "Settings"
    * "Quit [PostureApp]"
3.  Assign this menu to the system tray icon.
4.  Make the tray icon visible when the application starts.
5.  Implement basic functionality:
    * "Open [PostureApp] Window": If the main window is hidden or minimized, show and activate it.
    * "Settings": Call the same method that the "Settings" button on the dashboard calls to open the `SettingsDialog`.
    * "Quit [PostureApp]": Properly close the application (ensure threads are stopped, settings saved if necessary, call `QApplication.quit()`).
6.  Ensure the application continues to run (and the tray icon remains) if the main window is closed (e.g., by clicking the 'X' button), unless "Quit" is selected from the tray menu. You might need to override the main window's `closeEvent`.
Prompt 17: System Tray Session Control and Background Operation

Plaintext

Based on the previous system tray implementation:
1.  Modify the tray icon menu:
    * The "Start Session" action should be dynamically labeled. If no session is active, it's "Start Session". If a session is active, it's "Stop Session".
    * Let this tray action call the same underlying `start_session_logic()` and `stop_session_logic()` methods that the dashboard buttons use.
2.  Implement `start_session_logic()`:
    * Performs calibration if not already calibrated for the current run or if settings require re-calibration.
    * Starts `WebcamThread` and monitoring.
    * Updates UI states (disables "Start Session" buttons/actions, enables "Stop Session" buttons/actions, updates tray menu item text).
    * Sets a flag `is_session_active = True`.
3.  Implement `stop_session_logic()`:
    * Stops `WebcamThread`.
    * Saves session data (reminder count).
    * Updates UI states (enables "Start Session", disables "Stop Session", updates tray menu item text).
    * Sets `is_session_active = False`.
4.  Background Operation:
    * In the main window's `closeEvent(event)`:
        * If `is_session_active` is true, instead of closing the application, just hide the main window (`self.hide()`) and `event.ignore()`. This allows monitoring to continue in the background.
        * A message box could inform the user: "[PostureApp] is still running in the system tray and monitoring your posture."
        * If `is_session_active` is false, or if the quit is initiated from the tray menu, then allow the window to close and the app to exit (if it's the last window).
5.  The tray icon could subtly change to indicate an active session (e.g., if you have two versions of the icon, one normal, one "active"). This is optional.
Prompt 18: In-App Update Mechanism (Check and Notify)

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Assume an `update-info.json` file is hosted on Supabase Storage (or any accessible URL for now). It has content like:
    ```json
    {
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "notes": "Bug fixes and performance improvements.",
      "download_urls": {
        "windows": "[https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.exe](https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.exe)",
        "macos": "[https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.dmg](https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.dmg)",
        "linux": "[https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.AppImage](https://example.com/PostureApp-1.1.0.AppImage)"
      }
    }
    ```
2.  Define the current application version within your Python code (e.g., `CURRENT_APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"`).
3.  Implement a function `check_for_updates()`:
    * Uses `requests` library (install it) or `PyQt6.QtNetwork` to fetch `update-info.json` from the hardcoded URL.
    * Parses the JSON.
    * Compares `CURRENT_APP_VERSION` with the `version` from the JSON. (Simple string comparison is okay, or use a version parsing library if you want semantic versioning logic).
    * If a newer version is available:
        * Show a non-intrusive notification in the `DashboardView` (e.g., a `QLabel` at the top: "Update available: Version [new_version]. Click here to download."). Make this label clickable.
        * Store the `download_urls` and `notes` from the manifest.
    * Handle network errors or invalid JSON gracefully (e.g., log error, do nothing visible to user).
4.  Call `check_for_updates()` automatically when the application starts (e.g., after the dashboard is shown).
Prompt 19: In-App Update (Download and Install Prompt)

Plaintext

Based on the previous update check mechanism:
1.  When the "Update available" notification label (from Prompt 18) is clicked:
    * Determine the correct download URL for the current platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). You'll need a helper function `get_platform()` that returns 'windows', 'macos', or 'linux'.
    * Use the `requests` library with `stream=True` or `PyQt6.QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager` to download the installer file in the background (to avoid freezing the UI).
    * Show a progress indicator (e.g., a `QProgressDialog` or update a label "Downloading update... X%").
2.  Once the download is complete:
    * Show a `QMessageBox` to the user: "Update [New Version] downloaded. Release notes: [notes from manifest]. Restart and install now?"
    * If the user clicks "Yes" or "Install Now":
        * (Simplest approach for desktop Python apps) Open the folder containing the downloaded installer using `QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl.fromLocalFile(download_path_directory))`.
        * Inform the user: "Please run the downloaded installer. The application will now close."
        * Quit the application (`QApplication.quit()`).
    * If the user clicks "No" or "Later", dismiss the message box.
3.  Handle download errors (network issues, file writing permissions).
Note: Automating the installer launch and self-replacement can be very complex and platform-dependent. Guiding the user to run the installer is a common and robust approach.

Prompt 20: "About" Section

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  Create a new `QDialog` subclass named `AboutDialog`.
2.  Populate `AboutDialog` with:
    * Application Name: "[PostureApp]" (large font).
    * Version Number: Display `CURRENT_APP_VERSION` (defined in Prompt 18).
    * Copyright notice: "© [Current Year] YourCompanyName. All rights reserved." (Get current year dynamically).
    * Brief description: "PostureApp helps you improve your posture using your webcam and real-time feedback."
    * A QLabel for Privacy emphasis: "Webcam processing is done locally on your computer. No images or video are transmitted or stored."
    * Clickable links (QLabels with `setOpenExternalLinks(True)` or buttons opening URLs with `QDesktopServices`):
        * "Privacy Policy" (opens a placeholder URL like "https://example.com/privacy").
        * "Help/Documentation" (opens "https://example.com/help").
        * "Contact Us/Support" (opens "https://example.com/contact").
    * An "OK" button to close the dialog.
3.  Add an "About [PostureApp]" action to the main window's menu bar (if you create one, e.g., under a "Help" menu) or link it from the `SettingsDialog` or `DashboardView`. When clicked, it should show the `AboutDialog`.
Prompt 21: Error Handling and User Guidance (Webcam, MediaPipe)

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  **Webcam Access Issues (enhance `WebcamThread` or its controller):**
    * Before starting webcam capture:
        * If `get_available_cameras()` (from Prompt 12) returns an empty list: Show a `QMessageBox` error: "No webcam detected. Please connect a webcam to use [PostureApp]." Prevent session start.
        * When trying to open the webcam, if OpenCV returns an error or no frame:
            * Distinguish if possible (though OpenCV might not make it easy):
                * Permission denied: "Webcam access denied. Please grant permission in your system settings."
                * Webcam in use: "Webcam is currently in use by another application."
            * Show a `QMessageBox` with the appropriate error. Prevent session start or stop the current attempt.
    * If multiple webcams are available and the selected one fails, suggest trying another from Settings if the `SettingsDialog` is implemented.
2.  **Poor Landmark Detection (in `WebcamThread` or main logic):**
    * During calibration ("Capture Good Posture"): If MediaPipe fails to detect a pose or key landmarks (e.g., shoulders, head) are missing from `pose_landmarks_list`:
        * Prevent calibration completion.
        * Display a non-modal message near the webcam feed or in a status bar: "Cannot detect posture. Ensure face and shoulders are clearly visible, improve lighting, or move closer."
    * During active monitoring: If landmarks are consistently lost for several seconds:
        * Show a temporary, non-intrusive message like the one above. Don't stop the session unless it's persistent for too long.
Prompt 22: Error Handling (Network & Subscription) and Final Wiring

Plaintext

Based on the previous code:
1.  **Network & Subscription Error Refinements:**
    * **Login (Prompt 5 & 6):**
        * Explicitly handle network errors (e.g., `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` if using requests for Supabase, or equivalent for `supabase-py`) when trying to authenticate or check subscription. Display: "Network error. Could not connect to login service. Please check your internet connection."
    * **Update Check (Prompt 18):**
        * If fetching `update-info.json` fails due to network issues: Silently fail or log to console. Optionally, show a brief status message like "Could not check for updates: No internet." that fades away.
    * **Subscription Check during Active Session (Advanced - Optional):** If the app were to re-validate subscription periodically during a long session:
        * If a check reveals subscription is now expired: Show a `QMessageBox`: "Your subscription has expired. Please renew to continue. Stopping current session." Then stop the session. (This is likely overkill for v1.0 as per spec, which focuses on check at login/start.)
2.  **Final Wiring and Review:**
    * Ensure all buttons and actions (main window, dialogs, tray menu) are correctly connected to their respective functions.
    * Confirm that application state (e.g., `is_session_active`, `current_settings`) is consistently managed and respected by different parts of the app.
    * Check for proper thread termination when the application quits or a session stops.
    * Make sure QSettings are saved when the application quits gracefully (e.g., in the main window's `closeEvent` if not already handled by `SettingsDialog` "Save").
    * Ensure the "Logout" button on the dashboard correctly signs out from Supaba
